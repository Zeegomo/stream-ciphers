Pure Rust implementation of the [Rc4 Stream Cipher Algorithm][1].

[Documentation][docs-link]

## ⚠️ Security Warning: [Hazmat!][hazmat-link]

This crate does not ensure ciphertexts are authentic (i.e. by using a MAC to
verify ciphertext integrity), which can lead to serious vulnerabilities
if used incorrectly!

No security audits of this crate have ever been performed, and it has not been
thoroughly assessed to ensure its operation is constant-time on common CPU
architectures.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.56** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
done with a minor version bump.

## SemVer Policy

- All on-by-default features of this library are covered by SemVer
- MSRV is considered exempt from SemVer as noted above
